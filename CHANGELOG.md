## 4.3.0
The 4.3.0 release seems somwhat meager compared to the vast ammount of changes performed in the 4.2.0 release.
Don't be fooled tho. As this release is introducing a major overhaul on the way entity attributes (grants)
are handled in the application. This error prone construction of having hard-coded references to the supported 
attributes/grants resulted in many errors and bugs throughout the lifetime of SPD.

Having these attributes in a configurable json file makes managing them much easier.
